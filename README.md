# Persistent Energy Modes Across Material Platforms

**Author:** Dr. L. Vardien Askel
**Status:** Open Research Draft
**Contact:** themaindeus@proton.me

## Overview

This repository presents a theoretical–experimental framework for studying energy as a dynamic structure potentially independent of material support.
The framework defines energy modes, flows, and patterns that are observable, persistent, and reproducible across different material platforms, while integrating multiscale correlations, sensitivity analyses, and predictive modeling.

The goal is to provide a unified, auditable approach for exploring energy persistence, cross-platform validation, and operational extrapolation, while remaining accessible to scientific collaborators.

## Contents

* **/text/** — Conceptual manuscript outlining theoretical definitions, operational guidelines, and model structures.
* **/simulations/** — Guidelines for numerical simulations, including multiscale operators, extrapolable energy kernels, and predictive analyses.
* **/experiments/** — General experimental framework, instrumentation principles, reproducibility criteria, and cross-platform validation.
* **/examples/** — Sample simulations and illustrative energy mode predictions.

Each component emphasizes transparency, verification, and methodological clarity.

## Key Features

* Definition and measurement of energy modes across heterogeneous systems.
* Quantifiable criteria to distinguish persistent energy from emergent or spurious effects.
* Bayesian ensembles and statistical reconstruction of energy patterns.
* Predictive kernels with cross-validation, noise filtering, and robustness tests.
* Modular, auditable framework supporting reproducibility and verification.

## Reproducibility

Protocols and structures are included to ensure replicability across independent laboratories:

* Standardized data formats, metadata, and conceptual vectors.
* Statistical criteria for significance, error control, and signal-to-noise validation.
* Pre-simulation pipelines for model validation before experimental implementation.
* Guidelines for documenting results and reporting reproducibility metrics.
